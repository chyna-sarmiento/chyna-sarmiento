Hi, my name is Chyna Sarmiento.<br/>
Everything here is 100% plucked from the very depths of my creativity.<br/>

:mortar_board: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Specialisation in Artificial Intelligence, Batch 2023<br/>
:computer: don't mind me, I'm just mastering my craft since 2012<br/>
:stars: going to do big things soon<br/>

Projects made with quality in mind and with ðŸ’–passionðŸ’–<br/>
Don't worry, I'll only be putting the most important/best projects to showcase.<br/>
Feel free to use my work, but don't forget to give a lil bit of credit!<br/>
