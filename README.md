Hi, my name is Chyna Sarmiento.<br/>
Everything here is 100% plucked from the very depths of my creativity.<br/><br/>
Just a few things to note:<br/>
:mortar_board: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Specialisation in Artificial Intelligence, Batch 2023<br/>
:computer: don't mind me, I'm just mastering my craft<br/>
:stars: going to do big things soon<br/>
<br/>
I uphold all of my work to its greatest worth, down to the really simple projects.<br/>
Don't worry, I'll only be putting the most important/best projects that I could showcase to impress you.<br/>
Feel free to use my work, but don't forget to give a lil bit of credit!<br/>
